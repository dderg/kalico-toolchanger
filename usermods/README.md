# User Mods

This folder is intended for others to propose new functions and features, and keep it quarantined until Viesturz (the creator and maintainer) has the chance to review it.

## Ground rules

It is important to make your proposed function understandable in what it is trying to do and how it achieves that goal. In addition, there is also the concerns of malice code.

With that in mind, the following are rules that are to be strictly followed for the Pull Request (PR) to be accepted:

1. The added feature needs to be generally related to tool-changing.

2. Can be reasonably verified that it does not do anything malicious.

3. Please put your custom files here, in a folder of your GitHub profile name i.e.: `[your-profile-name]`/`[files/folder]`

4. A `README.md` file with:
   
   - 1-2 paragraphs with description of expected use
   
   - Configuration sections and their parameters explained
   
   - Commands and their parameters explained Optionally.
